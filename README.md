# umn-edx-professional-portfolio

## SUMMARY
This is my repository for construction of my professional portfolio.  I am following the general guidelines from an assignment given at a UMN coding bootcamp I am attending even though I have something else in mind for the final site.  At the moment I am unsure whether I will use what I have coded here or construct something different, but whatever I use likely will be copied over to my portfolio's final location.
